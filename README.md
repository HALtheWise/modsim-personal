ModSim [Modeling and Simulation of the Physical World] was a class I took during my first semester at Olin College (Fall 2015). 
It was my first introduction to MatLab, and involved a lot of independent research, partner work, and presentation skills.

<i>This course provides an introduction to mathematical modeling and computer simulation of physical systems. 
Working with a broad range of examples, students practice the steps in modeling and analyzing a physical system, 
learn the role of models in explaining and predicting the behavior of the physical world, and develop skills with 
the programming and computational tools necessary for simulation. Students work in a studio environment on 
increasingly open-ended projects, and learn how to present their results, with an emphasis on visual and oral communication.

in their own repositories, linked below.
